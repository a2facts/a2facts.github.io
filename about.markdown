This is the Accountable to Facts blog. I care about how ideas shape the world and this is a space for me to reflect on eclectic ideas that drive me. I think about economics, evidence-driven policy, and the politics of science and innovation. I believe that careful reasoning, clear data, and upfront acknowledgment of our agendas and biases are the tools we need to make progress together.

Outside of policy and data, I find balance in practices like meditation, and I draw inspiration from art and music. These rational and creative interests inform the way I approach both my work and my life. I may share some aspects of my practice that I find useful as well as a record of my favorite examples I find along the way.

Feel free to get in touch; I would love to connect with creators who also want to make the world a little better and a little more empirical. I can be reached at the username jbb774 at the domain tutamail dot com.
